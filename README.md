In this pandas challenge we were tasked with creating/manipulating code that analyzed data from schools and their standardized test data of students.
We analyzed things such as the averages of reading and math test scores, how may students passed these tests and how much the budget for schools were. 
Drilling down, we also looked at these stats for each school in the data as well as other things such as per student budgets and math/reading scores by each grade level, scores based on school sizes/school type etc. 
This analysis allows readers to get a snapshot of how high schoolers are doing in this data set and see how many are passing their tests as well as which groups are doing the best.
